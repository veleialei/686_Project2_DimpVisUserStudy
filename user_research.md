*Retrieve Value (RV):*
Read the changing value of a data object.
Example: “When is point A at age=50 and height=5?”

*Comparison (CO):*
Compare  the  changing  values  of  two  data  objects.
Example:  “When is point A’s age and height greater than point B’s?”

*Characterize Distribution (CD):*
Identify characteristics of the overall trend of a data object’s changing value.
Example: “After the age and height of point A have been increasing, find the first year when they are both decreasing.”

*Outlier Detection (OD):*
Find when a data object’s changing value deviates from the overall trend of all other data objects.
Example:  “Find the first year when point A is moving in the opposite direction of the other points.”
